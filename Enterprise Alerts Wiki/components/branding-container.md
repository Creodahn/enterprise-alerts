# branding-container

This component creates a branded container block, with a `{{branded-text-canvas}}` in a `<header>` element, and a `<footer>` containing version information.

Example:

```
{{#branding-container}}
  <div>This content is between the header and footer blocks</div>
{{/branding-container}}
```
